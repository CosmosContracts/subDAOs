# 6/6 Conferences budget - After-Cosmoverse Hackathon

This is the sixth proposal, following the passing of the previous signaling proposal for Juno's presence at conferences and events, specifically for the After-Cosmoverse Hackathon event.

## About this event
Cosmoverse is happening in Istanbul this year, Juno Communications SubDAO would like to organize a Cosmos-specific Hackathon in collaboration with the Cosmoverse team and local partners.

It will be held in Istanbul (Turkey) October 5th to 6th. 

**Note:** Dates are still to be confirmed according to venue availability

*This proposal is not for the Cosmoverse conference which will have a separate one in the future, but for a hackathon to take place after the Cosmoverse event.*

Here is a breakdown of what we will get accomplished at this conference:

- **Hackathon after Cosmoverse**
    - Hackathon event organized by Cosmoverse team and Juno in collaboration with local partners and other sponsors
    - Similar to the one held in Colombia
    - Technical keynotes by Juno contributors
    - ~100-200 people expected to attend
    - Vested Hackathon prizes sponsored by Hackjuno/Core-1 subDAOs
    - 2-4 People in presence
