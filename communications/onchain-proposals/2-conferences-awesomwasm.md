# 2/6 Conferences budget - AwesomWasm

This is the second proposal, following the passing of the previous signaling proposal for Juno's presence at conferences and events, specifically for the AwesomWasm event.

## What is AwesomWasm
AwesomWasm is a 5-day conference + hackathon organized by Confio. It's the first conference with a specific focus on CosmWasm. As Juno being one of the early adopters of the module and one of the major chains in Cosmos supporting permissionless smart contracts, we think sponsoring this event is very important.

It will be held in Berlin from July 12th to July 16th.

Please visit their [website](https://www.awesomwasm.com/) for more information.

Here is a breakdown of what we will get accomplished at this conference:

- **AwesomWasm**
    - Jake's keynote
    - Participation in a panel by a Juno contributor (Either from Core 1 or Core 2)
    - General sponsorship & logos
    - 2 People in presence

## Budget

| Conference Name | Date | Location | Sponsor Budget | Comms Budget |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| AwesomWasm | July 12,13 | Berlin | 5,000 USD | 2,000 USD |

Total request: **10.000 JUNO** valued **~7.000 USD**

*NOTE: Even if the proposal doesn't pass, Juno contributors are allowed to go to the conference at their own expense. Additionally, Core-1 members will not be reimbursed for any expenses.*
