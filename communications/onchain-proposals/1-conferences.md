The team has been working on a close-to-0 budget till now, using treasury for reimbursing expenses only. You can monitor all the spending proposals submitted on DAO DAO [here](https://daodao.zone/it/dao/juno15zw5zt2pepx8n8675dz3k3yscdu94d24yhqqz00uzyx7ydf2vfmswz6nzw#proposals).

## Budget request
With the following proposals, we are asking funding from the community pool to cover conference-related expenses. 

The conference season is about to begin, and we would like to participate in some as sponsors and in others as participants. We think that the presence of Juno in these conferences is important, asserting Juno as the leading CosmWasm blockchain in the Interchain Ecosystem and showing off all the good work being put by the Core Development team.

Here is a table of the upcoming conferences, we intend to support, and their corresponding budgeting:


| Conference Name | Date | Location | Sponsor Budget | Comms Budget |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| AwesomWasm | July 12,13 | Berlin | 5,000 USD | 2,000 USD |
| OsmoCon     | July 21     | Paris      | 15,000 USD  | 1,000 USD   |
| Nebular Hacker House | July 22, 23 | Paris | 5,000 USD | 2,000 USD |
| Nebular Summit | July 24, 25 | Paris | 9,000 USD | 2,000 USD |
| HackWasm Italy | September 16th (tbc) | Italy | 8,000 USD | 0 USD |
| HackWasm Turkey | October 5,6 | Istanbul | 15,000 USD | 2,000 USD |

*NOTE: Cosmoverse will take place in Istanbul on 2nd-4th of October. Discussion is still ongoing with the organizers and a separate proposal will be submitted when details are ready.*

## Community Spend
*Pure sponsorships costs:* 57,000 USD
*Comms costs:* 9,000 USD (500 USD * Person * Day)

Comms Costs include the following
- Travel & Accommodation
- Equipment

*Total funding requested:* **66,000 USD** 

The funds will go to the Juno Communications SubDAO treasury. For spending purposes, tokens will be sold OTC (Over-the-Counter) or through low-volume-transaction swapping over DEXs when needed.
Juno Governance can always recall the funds back to the community pool.
Any unspent remaining funds will stay in the SubDAO treasury for future usage.

*NOTE: Two conferences are already waiting for contract signing. Until the payment deadline is close, the SubDAO might consider liquid staking the tokens in the mean time*

## How to vote
We are submitting a total of 6 proposals for the 6 conferences above, community is free to vote on each proposal to signal whether we should support a conference or not. 

The expenses for each conference are the best deal we were able to have after negotations and discussions with the organizers, modifying the sponsor packages to best suit our needs.

Juno Communications SubDAO is in favor of supporting the conferences listed above.

This proposal is signaling only to introduce the proposals for each conference. In case if this proposal gets rejected, it would show that the community do not want the Communications SubDAO to work on conferences and events at all.
