# 5/6 Conferences budget - HackWasm Italy

This is the fifth proposal, following the passing of the previous signaling proposal for Juno's presence at conferences and events, specifically for the HackWasm Italy event.

## What is HackWasm Italy
HackWasm Italy will be a 2-day hackathon organized by Juno in collaboration with local partners, including [Made in Block](https://twitter.com/madeinblock_), other validators and other ecosystem chains. 

Made In Block is already hosting Cosmos Meetups monthly, partially self funded and partially supported by the [ATOM Accelerator DAO](https://twitter.com/ATOMAccelerator/status/1648703193742974976). Italy has a flourishing developer ecosystem which is yet to discover about Cosmos and the blockchain space in general. Considering that meetups are attended by an average of 50-60 people, it's expected that the Hackathon will attract around 100 developers who could be ready to join the ecosystem and build something cool.

Here a few links about the past meetups:

It will be held in Milan (Italy) September 16th and 17th. 

**Note:** Dates are still to be confirmed according to venue availability.

Here is a breakdown of what we will get accomplished at this conference:

- **HackWasm Italy**
    - Introduce new developers to Cosmos and CosmWasm
    - Technical keynotes by Juno contributors
    - Jury seat for a Juno core team member
    - Vested Hackathon prizes sponsored by Hackjuno/Core-1 subDAOs

## Budget

| Conference Name | Date | Location | Sponsor Budget | Comms Budget |

| HackWasm Italy | September 16th (tbc) | Italy | 8,000 USD | 0 USD |

## Conflict of interest
Dimi (Core-1 member) has a major share participation in Made in Block, 100% of the grant requested will be used for organization of the event only.

*NOTE: Even if the proposal doesn't pass, Juno contributors are allowed to go to the conference at their own expense. Additionally, Core-1 members will not be reimbursed for any expenses.*
